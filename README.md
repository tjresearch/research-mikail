# Physics Simulators to Help Learn Physics
A set of physics simulators, one for each approximate unit of physics: mechanics, universal gravitation, electronics and magnetism, and waves

## physics-engine
Rigidbody mechanics simulator, currently simultaneous collisions are pretty jittery

# Requirements

## Running:
I've put binaries for Windows and Linux in the release section of each repository and this one, eventually there will be a web version

## Building:

[rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup) - Latest stable rust toolchain

Computer

With the latest stable rust toolchain from rustup, run `cargo run --release` to compile and run, compiling will probably take >10 minutes the first time because of all the dependencies.

# Screenshots:
//TODO
